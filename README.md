# Project Name

Brief project description here.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your local machine.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my_project
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the PostgreSQL database and the CSV importer container.

4. Wait for the containers to start and execute the CSV import script.

   The PostgreSQL container will initialize the database schema using the `init.sql` script, and the CSV importer container will run the `import_csv.py` script to import CSV data into the database.

5. Once the containers are running and the data is imported, you can access your PostgreSQL database as needed.

## Usage

Describe how to use or interact with the project. Include any relevant information for users or developers.

## Cleanup

To stop and remove the Docker containers and clean up resources, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
